## Using Docker

This project contains a `Dockerfile` as well as a `docker-compose.yml` to run it within a Docker container.

### Step 1 | Create configuration file

In the `php` directory, copy the content or rename `config.json.sample` to a file called `config.json`. Then we need to modify some information contained in it.

Modify SQL database connection info to match you local database setup.

``` json
"opal":{
     "host": "host.docker.internal",
     "port": "3306",
     "name": "xxxxxxxxxx",
     "username": "xxxxxxxxx",
     "password": "xxxxxxxxx"
},
"register":{
     "host":"host.docker.internal",
     "port":"3306",
     "name":"xxxxxxxx",
     "username": "xxxxxxx",
     "password": "xxxxxxxxx",
     "enabled":1
},
"opalGuest":{
     "host": "host.docker.internal",
     "port": "3306",
     "name": "xxxxxxxxx",
     "username": "guest",
     "password": "Vud2l6SobIle"
}
```

Modify the firebase connection info to match your personal firebase app:

``` json
{
     "_comment":"API/database configs found in firebase",
     "apiKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "authDomain": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "databaseURL": "xxxxxxxxxx",
     "projectId": "xxxxxxxx",
     "storageBucket": "xxxxxxxxx",
     "messagingSenderId": "xxxxxxxxxx",
     "appId": "xxxxxxxx"
}
```

### Step 2 | Run the Docker scripts

To do so, call `docker-compose up` from the project's root. Once the image is built and the container running, you can access it via `http://localhost:8083` from your browser.

If port `8083` is already in use, change the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.

To force a re-build of the image. You may call `docker-compose build` before running or `docker-compose up --build` to force a re-build when running the container.
